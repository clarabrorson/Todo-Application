# Project TODO

## Description
The TODO application is set with a menu system that can manage CRUD operations on a mongoDB database. It allows the user to handle TODO items by creating, reading, updating and deleting them. 

My motivation behind building the project was to create a functional TODO application. The application could be used in real-life scenarios wich made the process more motivating. 
The application can help to solve the problem of task managment and help manage and organize daily life.

The project gave me valuable experience implementing CRUD operations and integrating with a MongoDB database.
